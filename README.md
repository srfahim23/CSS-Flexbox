# CSS-Flexbox
# CSS Flexbox Layout Module
Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

.Bloxk, for sections in a webpage
.Inline, for text
.Table, for two-dimensional table data
.Positioned, for explicit position of an element 

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

# Broweser Support
The flexbox properties are supported in all modenr browsers.

Note: You can see the browser i just added in the top 

# Flexbox Elements 
To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.

The above represents a flex container (the blue area) with three flex items.
